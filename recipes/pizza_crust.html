    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li> 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li> 2 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting</li>
      <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li> 2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
      <li><p>Combine bread flour, olive oil, sugar, salt, and yeast mixture in a mixing bowl; stir well to combine. Beat until a stiff dough has formed. Cover the bowl; let rise at room temperature until dough doubles in volume, about 30 minutes.</p></li>
      <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p></li>
      <li><p>Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a thin crust. Cover with your favorite sauce and toppings.</p></li>
